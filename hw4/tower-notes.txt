To find the ambiguous puzzle, I ran the following command:
    
    ambiguous(N, C, T1, T2)

The following was the first result:

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
N = 4
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]] 

This means that for N = 1, 2, or 3, there are no ambiguous puzzles.
